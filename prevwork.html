			<p>Below is a list of my past works in various fields. Ranging from Websites to personal accomplishments.</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Web Development/Design</h2>
			<br />
				<h1><a href="http://www.Champoux-photo.com"target="_blank">Chad Champoux's Photography</a></h1>
				<p>Behind the scenes work a couple years ago. He's since updated the website again to accommodate for his growing business.</p>
				
			<br />
			
			<h2>Personal</h2>
			<br />
				<h1><a href="http://raven8sp.proboards.com/index.cgi?" target="_blank">The MMM</a></h1>
				<p>It's a community that a I've been preforming upkeep for on a regular basis for the last 5 years. It was built with proboards so it's not all custom built. The site itself is a text-based Roleplay based in the Megaman universe. The site has its own turnbased battle system where creative freedom is your prime resource and guideline. Although the stat guide looks daunting at first it does not take that long to learn the ins and outs of it.
				<br /><br />
				My username is Shasticus and my job by title is "Network Guide" but in actuality I am a Battle moderator, Roleplay moderator, Site Moderator, and a general voice of reason. My collective characters page can be found here: <a href="http://www.raven8sp.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=stats&action=display&thread=8406">Shasts' Stuff</a></p>
				<br /><br />
				<h1><a href="http://chaoticage.com/dalras/" target="_blank">Dalras, a custom Magic: The Gathering set</a></h1>
				<p>A collaborative custom Magic set designed and developed by a few friends of mine and myself. It's based in a world of Centaurs, Demons and imps, Merfolk, Faeries, and of course the occasional human. The set featured a sub-theme of the 'Holy' subtype for instant and sorceries, power counters which interacted primarily with Blue, and coin flips. It was slated to be set 1 of 3 but real life got in the way. The database is maintained by my friend Pete, who was the kickstarter for the idea.</p>
				<br /><br />
				<h1><a href="kitten_kombat.html">Kitten Kombat</a></h1>
				<p>A card game co designed and developed by yours truly. An overview of the game can be found <a href="kitten_kombat.html">here</a>. As well as <a href="kitten_kombat_rules.html">rules</a> and the <a href="kitten_kombat_contents.html">game's cards</a>. This page is being updated infrequently as we are changing aspects of the game too often for me to keep up. Also note that neither of us are artists. So none of the cards have artwork.</p>
				<br /><br />
				<h1>Contract (Name in progress)</h1>
				<p>A good friend of mine and I are in the midst of concepting another card game based in medival times where you're a noble enticed into demon contract(s). In order to keep your soul, and win the game, you must balance wealth, adoration, and power while still paying tribute to your demoninc benefactor and reducing the opposing players to ruin.</p>
